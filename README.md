# Approximation algorithm

Approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms that find approximate solutions to optimization problems (in particular NP-hard problems) with provable guarantees on the distance of the returned solution to the optimal one.

There is widespread interest in theoretical computer science to better understand the limits to which we can approximate certain famous optimization problems. 

Approximation algorithms as a research area is closely related to and informed by inapproximability theory where the non-existence of efficient algorithms with certain approximation ratios is proved by means of reductions.
